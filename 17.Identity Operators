#Identity operators are used to compare things not to see whether they are equal, but to see if they are the same object with the same memory address.

a = ["boy", "girl"]
b = ["boy", "girl"]
c = a

print(a is c)
#Output: True #because c is same object as a

print(a is b)
#Output: False #because b isn't same object as a

print(a is not b)
#Output: True #because b isn't same object as a

print(a==c)
#Output: True #because x is equal to y
